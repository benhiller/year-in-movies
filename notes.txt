ideas for units:
- top directors
- top actors
- top genres
- top decades
- longest/shortest movie
- watches by month
- most obscure movie
- highest rated/lowest rated
- minutes spent watching movies
- where i watched the movie

layout ideas:
- split page in half, with covers of movies i watched on right. click on item to filter to just those movies?
- more standard layout, two columns of units, maybe section with posters at bottom?
