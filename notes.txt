ideas for units:
v top directors
v top actors
v top decades
v top genres
v minutes spent watching movies
v longest/shortest movie
v watches by month
v most obscure movie
v highest rated/lowest rated (but not my me... just average ratings)
x where i watched the movie

layout ideas:
- split page in half, with covers of movies i watched on right. click on item to filter to just those movies?
- more standard layout, two columns of units, maybe section with posters at bottom?


x show number only between cells with different count -> or will this look less good on actual data?

v credit tmdb for data!
v support sorting movies in posters by different values (watch date, release date, runtime, num ratings, average rating)

--

functionality:
- tooltip for movie poster, show when i watched it, other details?

ui:
v delay rendering posters grid until width is known
v disable animation on initial load
v padding for scrollbar?
- histogram for decade/month units
- custom scrollbar UI for horiz scrolling?
- add question mark to directorPlaceholder?
- modify how vh is calculated to avoid scrolling on ios
- improve spacing logic in posters grid
- tweak emoji spacing (maybe chrome specific?)
- use dark theme overall
- lots of polishing
- confirm badge positioning works for larger numbers
- animate sort order toggle rotation

data:
- only include directors/cast members who were in more than 1 movie
