ideas for units:
v top directors
v top actors
v top decades
v top genres
v minutes spent watching movies
v longest/shortest movie
v watches by month
v most obscure movie
v highest rated/lowest rated (but not my me... just average ratings)
x where i watched the movie

layout ideas:
- split page in half, with covers of movies i watched on right. click on item to filter to just those movies?
- more standard layout, two columns of units, maybe section with posters at bottom?


x show number only between cells with different count -> or will this look less good on actual data?

v credit tmdb for data!
v support sorting movies in posters by different values (watch date, release date, runtime, num ratings, average rating)

--

functionality:
- tooltip for movie poster, show when i watched it, other details?

ui:
v delay rendering posters grid until width is known
v disable animation on initial load
v padding for scrollbar?
v add question mark to directorPlaceholder?
v improve spacing logic in posters grid
v tweak emoji spacing (maybe chrome specific?)
v use dark theme overall
v confirm badge positioning works for larger numbers
v animate sort order toggle rotation
v histogram for decade/month units
x custom scrollbar UI for horiz scrolling?
v lots of polishing
v improve histogram + summary stats ui
v poster grid controls
x histogram labels?

mobile:
v modify how vh is calculated to avoid scrolling on ios
v fix rendering on mobile

data:
v take position in credits into account when sorting actors?
- only include directors/cast members who were in more than 1 movie?
- add films watched by language?
- handle movies with more than 1 director
- maybe remove lowest/highest rating + avg rating sort
- put runtime below release date in select
- add text on most/least obscure saying 'on TMDb'?
