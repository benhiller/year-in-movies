ideas for units:
v top directors
v top actors
v top decades
- top genres
- longest/shortest movie
- watches by month
- most obscure movie
- highest rated/lowest rated (but not my me... just average ratings)
v minutes spent watching movies
- where i watched the movie

layout ideas:
- split page in half, with covers of movies i watched on right. click on item to filter to just those movies?
- more standard layout, two columns of units, maybe section with posters at bottom?

tooltip for movie poster, show when i watched it, other details?

- only include directors/cast members who were in more than 1 movie
- show number only between cells with different count -> or will this look less good on actual data?
- add question mark to directorPlaceholder?

- credit tmdb for data!
